Overview This Python project demonstrates hand gesture recognition using the MediaPipe library. It allows you to control your Mac by performing specific hand gestures in front of your webcam. You can perform actions such as navigating between desktops, copying, pasting, selecting all, and triggering the Backspace action with various hand gestures. Functionalities Swipe to the next desktop by pointing your index and middle finger to the right. Swipe to the previous desktop by moving your index and middle finger to the right. Copy text or content by raising only your index finger. Paste text or content by raising only your pinky finger. Select all text or content by raising your index, middle, and ring fingers. Prerequisites Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed: Python 3.x (download and install from python.org) Required Python libraries: OpenCV (cv2) MediaPipe (mediapipe) PyAutoGUI (pyautogui) Pillow (PIL, for image processing) tkinter (usually comes bundled with Python) You can install these dependencies using pip with the following commands: pip install opencv-python pip install mediapipe pip install pyautogui pip install Pillow Use your webcam to perform the specified hand gestures in front of your computer to trigger the corresponding actions. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues with permissions (e.g., on macOS) when running PyAutoGUI commands, grant necessary permissions to allow keyboard and mouse control.
